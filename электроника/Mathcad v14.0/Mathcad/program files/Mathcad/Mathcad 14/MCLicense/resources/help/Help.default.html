			<p>The Mathcad License Setup wizard allows you to license your installation of Mathcad. If necessary, it directs you through the process of requesting your license file.</p>
			<p><b>Enterprise-edition users</b> should specify the name - and, if necessary, port number - of their license server when prompted.</p>
			<p><b>Single-user-edition users</b> are directed to the PTC License Management site. Use your PTC user account to log on and request your license file. If you do not have a PTC user account, you can create one when you request your license file. The wizard automatically saves your license file and configures Mathcad to look for it at startup. If you already have a valid license file, you can use this wizard to point Mathcad to it.</p>
			<p>Once Mathcad knows the location of your license file or server, it uses this information every time it launches. If Mathcad cannot find your license file or server, it launches this wizard. Should this happen, again point Mathcad to the license file.</p>

			<p>Specify whether you need to obtain a license file from PTC or configure Mathcad to use an existing license file.</p>
			<p>To obtain a license file from PTC, you must have Internet access on the workstation and a PTC user account. If you do not have a PTC user account, you can create one when you request your license file.</p>

			<p class="note">This page is for <b>single-user-edition</b> users only. Enterprise-edition users who reach this page should contact their system administrator.</p>
			<p>Specify the <b>Product Code</b> you received when you purchased Mathcad. If you did not receive a product code because you received an evaluation copy of Mathcad, select the <b>trial license</b> option.</p>
			<p>If you selected the <b>trial license</b> option, the wizard configures Mathcad to launch normally until the end of the evaluation period. Once the evaluation period ends, Mathcad will prompt you for a license file or server.</p>
			<p>If you obtain, or intend to obtain, a license for Mathcad before the evaluation period ends, launch Mathcad from a command line, followed by the text &quot; /license&quot;:</p>
			<p style="margin-left:20px" class="cmd">&quot;C:\Program Files\Mathcad\Mathcad 14\mathcad.exe&quot; /license</p>

			<h1><a id="ManualLicense">Manual Licensing Instructions</a></h1>
			<p>If you do not have Internet access on the computer that runs Mathcad, you can request a license file manually, rather than through the wizard.</p>
			<p>To manually request a license file, contact PTC License Management. A listing of phone numbers is available on the PTC Web site at <a href="http://www.ptc.com/olm/contacts.htm" target="_new">http://www.ptc.com/olm/contacts.htm</a>.</p>

			<p>The license server or file location has been recorded properly. Mathcad uses this information the next time you launch it. If Mathcad cannot find your license file or server, it launches this wizard. Should this happen, again point Mathcad to the license file.</p>
			<p>If you licensed Mathcad automatically, you can now find your license file (<b>license.dat</b>) in the <b>License</b> folder of your Mathcad installation.</p>
			<p>To exit the wizard, click <b>Finish</b>.</p>
