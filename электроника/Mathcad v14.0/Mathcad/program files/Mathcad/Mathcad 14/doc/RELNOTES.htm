		<h2>
			<a name="Whats_New_in_Mathcad">1. What's New in Mathcad</a>
		</h2>
		<h3>
			<a name="Whats_New_in_Mathcad14.11">What's New in Mathcad 14 M011</a>
		</h3>
		<p>There are no new features in Mathcad 14 M011.</p>
		<h3>
			<a name="Whats_New_in_Mathcad14.1">What's New in Mathcad 14 M010</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Mathcad 14 M010 fixes and improves existing functionality, and includes several new features:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Support for Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7.</li>
			<li>Support for currency units in calculations, through a new &quot;Money&quot; dimension.</li>
			<li>The <b>[Esc]</b> key now interrupts calculation during worksheet save, print, and print preview operations.</li>
			<li>&gamma; is now defined as Euler's Constant.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, support for certain features has been deprecated in this release. The <b>Dimensions</b> tab of the <b>Worksheet Options</b> dialog and support for file formats prior to Mathcad 7 will be removed from upcoming releases of Mathcad.</p>
		<h3>
			<a name="Whats_New_in_Mathcad14">What's New in Mathcad 14 F000</a>
		</h3>
		<p>Mathcad 14 includes enhancements and new features designed to increase usability and productivity:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Internationalization:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>Support for Unicode fonts and Asian operating systems has been improved.</li>
					<li>Mathcad is now translated into nine languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese), and supports 15 spell-check choices.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>2D graphs:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>2D graph format dialogs now contain a <b>Number Format</b> tab, which allows you to change the displayed precision of axes limits and ticks.</li>
					<li>Negative radii are now allowed in polar plots, and considered as phase shifts in angles.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>Three new solvers for ODEs:
				<ul type="circle">
							<li>
								<b>Adams</b>, designed to solve non-stiff systems.</li>
							<li>
								<b>BDF</b>, which uses backward differentiation formulas for solving stiff systems.</li>
							<li>
								<b>AdamsBDF</b>, which dynamically detects whether a system is stiff or not and calls Adams or BDF accordingly.</li>
						</ul>
			For <b>BDF</b> and <b>AdamsBDF</b>, the Jacobian (<b>J</b>) and tolerance (<b>tol</b>) arguments are optional, and either or both can be used.</li>
					<li>
						<b>Odesolve</b> now defaults to the option <b>Adams/BDF</b>, which calls the solver <b>AdamsBDF</b>. This returns results in more cases. Previously, the default option was <b>Fixed</b>, which calls a fixed-step solver.</li>
					<li>The new <b>statespace</b> function allows you to describe and solve linear, first-order ordinary differential equations in matrix format.</li>
					<li>
						<b>Radau</b> accepts three new optional arguments, to yield more accurate results.</li>
					<li>The context menu for <b>Find</b> has been reorganized to list solvers in the order Mathcad tries them: <i>Levenberg-Marquardt</i> first, <i>Conjugate Gradient</i> second, and <i>Quasi-Newton</i> last.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Math enhancements:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>The new gradient operator, available on the Calculus toolbar, returns a vector containing the partial derivatives of a function of multiple parameters. The gradient operator is particularly useful for the function genfit, which requires a vector of partial derivatives as an input argument.</li>
					<li>The new <b>Jacob</b> function computes the Jacobian of a vector function of multiple parameters, producing a matrix of expressions.</li>
					<li>New derivative and scaled-derivative Airy functions (<b>DAi</b>, <b>DAi.sc</b>, <b>DBi</b>, <b>DBi.sc</b>) calculate more quickly and precisely than taking the first derivative of the built-in Airy functions.</li>
					<li>The right-hand side of a definition can now be evaluated and the result bound to the variable; for example,<br />
						<span class="blockindent">x := 1cm + 2ft = 0.934m.</span>
					</li>
					<li>Improvements to explicit calculation allow you to present math expressions and equations in a more standards-compliant manner.</li>
					<li>
						&gamma; is now automatically defined as Euler's Constant.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Symbolics:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>Enhancements to Mathcad's symbolic calculation capabilities return answers to a wider range of problems and more detailed solutions for piecewise or periodic solutions.
				<ul type="circle">
							<li>As a result of these changes, Mathcad returns some results in a different, but equivalent, form than in previous versions.</li>
							<li>A full listing of functions that work with the symbolic engine is available in the Mathcad <b>Help</b>.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Three new functions (<b>Numer</b>, <b>Denom</b>, and <b>IsPrime</b>) return information about an expression or number that can be used in other functions.</li>
					<li>Three new keywords (<b>combine</b>, <b>rewrite</b>, and <b>confrac</b>) extend Mathcad's symbolic capabilities.</li>
					<li>Nine new modifiers (<b>all</b>, <b>degree</b>, <b>domain</b>, <b>exp</b>, <b>fully</b>, <b>ln</b>, <b>using</b>, <b>raw</b>, and <b>sincos</b>) allow you to modify various keywords.</li>
					<li>The <b>solve</b> keyword and other symbolic operators now return more detailed results. New modifiers such as <b>fully</b> and <b>all</b> return complete solutions.</li>
					<li>You can now apply vectorized functions or operators to a vector and evaluate it symbolically. Previously, you could only do so numerically.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>General utility:
		<ol type="1">
					<li>You can now compare two different XMCD worksheets, viewing math and text
elements that have been added, deleted, or changed with different colored highlights. You can even view differing results due to tolerance settings or algorithms between versions of Mathcad.</li>
					<li>You can now search and replace for text and math elements in collapsed areas.</li>
					<li>Images can be stored in JPEG format with adjustable image quality, potentially reducing the size of your worksheets.</li>
					<li>Activation has been replaced with a single-user license file, obtained automatically during installation (requires Internet access).</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<a name="Installation_Instructions">Installation of Mathcad</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			<a name="Release_Order">You may install Mathcad 14 on the same system as Mathcad 11, Mathcad 12, or Mathcad 13.</a>
		</p>
		<p>In order for all supported versions to work properly, they must be installed and repaired in the order they were released, starting with Mathcad 11. Apply any patches or updates for a particular release before proceeding to the next release.</p>
		<p>If you uninstall a version of Mathcad, you must repair any previous installed versions, then reinstall the uninstalled version (if necessary), then repair any successive installed versions.</p>
		<p>Before you install Mathcad 14 on a system alongside an earlier version of Mathcad, read the section titled <a href="#Side-by-Side_Installation_Issues">Side-by-Side Installation Issues</a>.</p>
		<h4>Before Upgrading</h4>
		<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Mathcad, be sure to have one of the following:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Serial number of your earlier Mathcad version, or</li>
			<li>The original installation media (CD), or</li>
			<li>Mathcad installed on a local drive.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The upgrade installation attempts to locate an earlier version on your system. If it fails to detect an earlier version, it prompts you to enter the serial number or insert the installation media. The Mathcad installer does not require that you remove any detected previous versions, although only Mathcad 11 and later have been tested and certified to work alongside a Mathcad 14 installation.</p>
		<h4>General Installation Instructions</h4>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive. The CD automatically starts the installation program. If the installation program does not start automatically, you can start it by choosing <b>Run</b> from the <b>Start</b> menu and typing <b class="mono">D:\SETUP</b> (where <b class="mono">D</b> is your CD-ROM drive). Click &quot;OK.&quot;</li>
			<li>Click the Mathcad icon on the main installation screen.</li>
			<li>When prompted, enter your product code, provided with your Mathcad CD, or by email for purchasers who download Mathcad.</li>

		</ol>
		<p>After you uninstall the Mathcad Beta software and repair any previous installed versions, install Mathcad.</p>
		<h4>Troubleshooting Unexpected Behavior</h4>
		<p>If you are experiencing unexpected behavior with Mathcad, such as getting error messages when you shouldn't or internal errors, the following steps may correct your problem:</p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li>Make sure no other versions of Mathcad except Mathcad 11 or later are installed on your system.</li>
			<li>Disable virus checking before installing Mathcad. Both Norton and McAfee anti-virus software as well as other products may cause problems on install.</li>
			<li>Do not run Norton CrashGuard together with Mathcad, since it can misinterpret normal program operations as crashes.</li>
			<li>Update your installed video and other device drivers. Updated versions are usually available on the Web site of your computer manufacturer or device vendor. Many users have corrected errors by simply updating their drivers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With these steps, you can avoid many common problems in your use of Mathcad. If you encounter any errors after taking these steps, please contact <a href="#Technical_Support">Technical Support</a> with the details and sample Mathcad files, so that they may investigate the problem further.</p>

		<h3>
			<a name="Side-by-Side_Installation_Issues">Side-by-side Installation Issues</a>
		</h3>
		<p>You can install and run Mathcad alongside Mathcad 11 and/or any later version, to ease conversion from old worksheets to new. The versions must be installed in order, from oldest to newest; failure to do so may cause problems using components. You can copy and paste regions from an older version into a newer version (for example, from Mathcad 11 into Mathcad 14), however pasting from a newer version to an older version is not supported and may crash the older product. When multiple versions of Mathcad are installed, the automation interface will only work on the most-recently used version of Mathcad. This may cause controls that invoke automation to stop working in older versions of Mathcad.</p>
