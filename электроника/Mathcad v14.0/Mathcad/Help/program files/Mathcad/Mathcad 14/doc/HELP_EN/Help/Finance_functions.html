<h4>Arguments:</h4>

<ul type="disc">
  <li><span class="hmath">rate</span> is the real, positive, scalar fixed interest 
    rate per period. Typically, <span class="math">0 &le; rate &lt; 1</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">nrate</span> is the real, positive, scalar nominal annual rate, which, when compounded multiple times per year, yields the APR. </li>
  <li><span class="hmath">apr</span> is the real, positive, scalar Annual Percentage Rate. It equals the nominal annual rate if compounding once a year. </li>
  <li><span class="hmath">fin_rate</span> and <span class="hmath">rein_rate</span> 
    are the real, scalar finance and reinvestment rates.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">nper</span> is the positive integer number of compounding 
    periods.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">npery</span> is the positive integer number of compounding 
    periods per year.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">per</span> is the positive integer period to find interest. 
    <span class="math">per &le; nper</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">pv</span> and <span class="hmath">fv</span> are the 
    real, positive present value and future values. If omitted, <span class="math">fv 
    = 0</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">start</span> and <span class="hmath">end </span>are 
    the positive integer starting and ending periods of accumulation. <span class="math">start 
    &le; end &le; nper</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">pmt</span> is the real payment made each period. It 
    usually includes principal and interest but no other taxes and fees.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">prin</span> is the real, positive initial principal.</li>
  <li><b class="hmath">sched</b> is a vector of interest rates, each of which 
    are applied over the same amount of time. </li>
  <li><b class="hmath">cash</b> is a vector of cash flows assigned at regular 
    intervals. Payments are entered as negative numbers and income as positive 
    numbers.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">type</span> (optional) is 0 for a payment made at the 
    end of the period or 1 for the beginning. If omitted, <span class="math">type 
    = 0</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="hmath">guess</span> (optional) is a numeric value which approximates 
    the answer, used as a starting point for the algorithm. If omitted, <span class="math">guess 
    = 0.1</span> (10%).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>Interest rates are expressed as decimals, such as <span class="math">.0825</span>, 
    or as percents, such as <span class="math">8.25%</span>. You may need to calculate 
    the interest rate per period. The rate equals the nominal annual rate divided by compounding periods in a year. For example, to find the interest rate per month 
    based on the nominal annual interest rate: <span class="math">nomrate = ann_rate/12</span>.</li>
  <li>Payments you make, such as deposits in a savings account or payments toward 
    a loan, must be entered as negative numbers. Cash you receive, such as dividend 
    checks, must be entered as positive numbers.</li>
