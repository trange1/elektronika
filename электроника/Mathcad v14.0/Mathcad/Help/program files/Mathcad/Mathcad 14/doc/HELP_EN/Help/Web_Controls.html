<p>Web Controls were designed for use with the <i>Mathcad Application
 Server</i> but can also be used in any Mathcad worksheet. They are similar to Mathsoft Controls.</p>

<p> Web Controls have two benefits in setup and use:</p>
<ul><li>Web Controls require no scripting. All setup is done through dialog boxes, while Mathsoft Controls require you to use VBscript or JScript.</li>
<li>The selections for each control are persistent; that is, they remain in the same selected state when a Mathcad worksheet is closed and reopened.</li></ul>



<p>Web Controls can be set to either text or numerical values. Text values 
 are passed as string variables.</p>

<p>The following Web Controls are available in Mathcad:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><a href="#TextBox">Text box</a></li>
 <li><a href="#CheckBox">Check box</a></li>
 <li><a href="#ListBox">List box/Combo box</a></li>
 <li><a href="#Radio">Radio button group</a></li>
 <li><a href="#Submit">Submit button</a></li> 
 </ul>


<h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="Graphics/H2.gif" width="12" height="18" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top">Application Server</td></tr>
</table>
</h2>
<p>When a Mathcad worksheet is opened in a Web browser from a site equipped
 with the Application Server, the Web Controls become HTML Forms controls.
 The user can change their values and recalculate the worksheet on the
 Application Server. Only values defined through a Web Control can be changed
 within a Web browser before being passed to the Application Server.</p>

<h4>Note:</h4>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Changing the value of a control will recalculate results within Mathcad
	 when <a href="Automatic_Calculation_Mode.html">Automatic Calculation</a> is
	 enabled in the worksheet, or by clicking on the control and pressing <b>[F9]</b>.</p></li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="Graphics/H2.gif" width="12" height="18" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top"><a name="TextBox">Text Box Properties</a></td></tr>
</table>
</h2>

<p>The following options are available on the Text Box Properties tab:</p>

<h3>Text box width (characters)</h3>

<p class="blockindent">The total length of the text string visible 
 in the text box at any given time. You can use either the arrow keys or 
 the mouse to move back and forth within the string. The minimum width 
 is 1, and the maximum is 255.</p>

<h3>Maximum text length</h3>

<p class="blockindent">The total length of the text string that 
 can be entered into the text box. The minimum allowable length is 1, and 
 the maximum is 255.</p>

<h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="Graphics/H2.gif" width="12" height="18" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top"><a name="CheckBox">Check Box Properties</a></td></tr>
</table>
</h2>

<p>The following options are available on the Check Box Properties tab:</p>

<h3>Label</h3>

<p class="blockindent">The descriptive text displayed next to the 
 check box in the worksheet. Changing a check box's label does not change 
 its value; check boxes only return either 0 or 1.</p>

<h3>Recalculate Web page when control value changes</h3>

<p class="blockindent">Forces a recalculation of your worksheet 
 when you either select or deselect the check box. This option is only 
 effective when the worksheet is opened in a browser and calculated by 
 the Mathcad Application Server.</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Note:</b> If you have more than one input control 
 in your worksheet, you may want to disable recalculation on the individual 
 controls and rely on a <a href="#Submit">Submit button</a> instead, as 
 this speeds up editing of the worksheet.</p>

<h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="Graphics/H2.gif" width="12" height="18" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top"><a name="ListBox">List Box/Combo Box Properties</a></td></tr>
</table>
</h2>

<p>The following options are available on the List/Combo Box Properties tab:</p>

<h3>Display height (rows)</h3>

<p class="blockindent">Controls how many choices (one per row) are 
 visible at any given time. This setting also affects how the control displays 
 in your worksheet.</p>

<p class="blockindent">If the display height is set to 1, this control 
 is shown as a standard combo box. For settings greater than 1, but less 
 than the number of entries in the Item list, the control displays as a 
 scrolling list box. If the display height is greater than or equal to 
 the number of entries in the Item list, the control appears in the worksheet 
 as a list box, with empty, unselectable lines following the list.</p>

<h3>Values equal names</h3>

<p class="blockindent">When this selection is enabled, the list 
 entries are passed to the variable &quot;as is.&quot; When 
 this selection is disabled, the list entries are mapped to values, which 
 are, in turn, passed to the variable defined by the control.</p>

<h3>Item list</h3>

<p class="blockindent">The choices available when the control is viewed in the
 worksheet. If you have disabled the &quot;Values equal names&quot; setting, this list
 consists of two columns: one for the Name, which is displayed in the control,
 and the other for the associated Value, which is passed to the worksheet. If &quot;Values
 equal names&quot; is enabled, this list consists of only one column, for the Name,
 which is also passed to the worksheet.</p>

<p class="blockindent">Below the list are three buttons for adding items to
 or deleting them from the list:</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Add Item</b> &ndash; Adds a line to the end of the
 list, and populates both the Name and Value fields with the text &quot;[New Item].&quot;</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Delete Item</b> &ndash; Removes the selected line
 from the list.</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Reset</b> &ndash; Deletes the entire list.</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Note:</b> When editing an entry in the list, you must
 click out of a field before clicking &quot;OK&quot; to accept your changes. If you do
 not click out of a field before clicking &quot;OK,&quot; the changes you make to that
 field are discarded.</p>

<h3>Recalculate web page when control value changes</h3>

<p class="blockindent">Forces a recalculation of your worksheet 
 when you change your selection. This option is only effective when the worksheet 
 is opened in a browser and calculated by the Mathcad Application Server.</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Note:</b> If you have more than one input control 
 in your worksheet, you may want to disable recalculation on the individual controls
 and rely on a <a href="#Submit">Submit button</a> instead, as this speeds up

<p>The following options are available on the Radio Button Group Properties tab:</p>

<h3>Values equal names</h3>

<p class="blockindent">When this selection is enabled, the list entries are
 passed to the variable &quot;as is.&quot; When this selection is disabled, the list
 entries are mapped to values, which are, in turn, passed to the variable defined by
 the control.</p>

<h3>Item list</h3>

<p class="blockindent">The choices available when the control is viewed in the
 worksheet. If you have disabled the &quot;Values equal names&quot; setting, this list
 consists of two columns: one for the Name, which is displayed in the control,
 and the other for the associated Value, which is passed to the worksheet. If &quot;Values 
 equal names&quot; is enabled, this list consists of only one column, for the Name,
 which is also passed to the worksheet.</p>

<p class="blockindent">Below the list are three buttons for adding 
 items to or deleting them from the list:</p>

<p class="blockindent"><b>Add Item</b> &ndash; Adds a line to the end of the
 list, and populates both the Name and Value fields with the text &quot;[New Item].&quot;</p>

<h3>Recalculate web page when control value changes</h3>

<p class="blockindent">Forces a recalculation of your worksheet when you
 change your selection. This option is only effective when the worksheet is opened
 in a browser and calculated by the Mathcad Application Server.</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><img src="Graphics/H2.gif" width="12" height="18" border="0"></td>
<td valign="top"><a name="Submit">Submit Button Properties</a></td></tr>
</table>
</h2>

<p>Submit buttons are used when your worksheet is calculated by the Mathcad 
 Application Server, to force a recalculation of the worksheet. Although you can force
 your worksheet to recalculate when changing the value of a control, it is less
 time-consuming to use a Submit button when you have more than one input control in
 your worksheet.</p>

<p>The only option available on the Submit Button Properties tab is:</p>

<h3>Label</h3>

<p class="blockindent">This is the description of the button, displayed on
 the button itself. The default value is &quot;Recalculate.&quot; Changing this
 value affects only the display of the button, and not the functionality.</p>
