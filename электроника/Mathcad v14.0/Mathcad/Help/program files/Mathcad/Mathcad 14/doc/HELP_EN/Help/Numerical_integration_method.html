<p>There are four numerical integration methods available within the <a href="Integration_operator.html">integration</a> 
operator. Mathcad attempts to autoselect the most appropriate method from the 
following list when the integral is evaluated:</p> 
<ul type="disc">
  <li> <b>Romberg:</b> applicable to most integrands, this method uses trapezoidal 
    approximations over an even number of subintervals, then compares sequential 
    estimates by summing the areas of the trapezoids. The method terminates when 
    the four most recent estimates differ by less than the value of the built-in 
    variable <a href="Accuracy.html">TOL</a>. Because the Romberg integration 
    method divides the integration interval into four subintervals, then successively 
    doubles the number of points, it can return incorrect answers for periodic 
    functions having periods <span class="math">1/2<sup>n</sup></span> times the length 
    of the interval. To avoid this problem, divide the interval into two uneven 
    subintervals and integrate over each subinterval separately. Mathcad sets 
    a limit on the number of times it will iterate this procedure. If the routine 
    reaches this limit without converging, or if the integrand is singular at 
    one or both of the endpoints of the interval of integration, then Mathcad 
    switches to the Singular Endpoint method.</li>
  <li> <b>Adaptive:</b> adaptive quadrature method for functions that change 
    rapidly over the interval of integration.</li>
  <li> <b>Infinite Limit:</b> appropriate for integrals where one or both of 
    the limits are infinite. The function being integrated must be real.</li>
  <li> <b>Singular Endpoint:</b> an open-ended Romberg method appropriate for 
    integrals which have singularities/infinities at one or both limits of integration. 
    Preliminary estimates to the integral are obtained using the midpoints of 
    subintervals, so the function is not evaluated at the endpoints <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span>. Estimates 
    are concentrated near the ends of the integration interval, where integrands 
    that are singular or that have an infinite derivative are likely to be changing 
    most rapidly. The number of subintervals is tripled at each step. There is 
    a set limit on the number of iterations through the open-ended Romberg method. 
    If the routine reaches this limit without returning an answer, the integral 
    is marked with an <a href="Numerical_Errors.html#TooManyIntegratorSteps">error</a> 
    indicating that it did not converge.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see which method was chosen, or to override the chosen method:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Right-click the integral symbol in an evaluated integration. The menu shows AutoSelect with a check next to it, and the chosen 
    method is indicated with a dot.</li>
  <li>If you wish to override the chosen method, click on another method in the list.</li>
  <li>Click outside the integration expression in your worksheet.</li>
</ol>

<p>The integral is reevaluated using the method you selected and is evaluated 
  that way until you specify another method or choose AutoSelect again.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4> 
<ul type="disc">
  <li> 
    <p>Decreasing <a href="Accuracy.html">TOL</a> may improve your results, but 
      at some point will make the integral fail to converge. A good working range 
      is 10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Setting large-valued endpoints to infinity and using the infinite endpoint 
      algorithm may yield better answers.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Sharply peaked integrands, or functions whose shape is not readily characterized 
      by a single length scale, do not evaluate accurately. This is the nature 
      of numerical integration. Accurate results may be obtained by breaking an 
      integral into pieces and separately integrating around the peak and away 
      from the peak.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>Mathcad generally cannot integrate functions that have singularities 
      on the interval of integration. Functions such as step and sawtooth functions 
      with many finite discontinuities may also lead to nonconverging integrals. 
      If you know the location of singularities in the integrand, you can often 
      obtain a correct numerical evaluation by splitting the integral into a sum 
      of integrals with these points as limits. A <a href="X-y_plot.html">plot</a> 
      of the integrand may help to indicate trouble spots.</p>
