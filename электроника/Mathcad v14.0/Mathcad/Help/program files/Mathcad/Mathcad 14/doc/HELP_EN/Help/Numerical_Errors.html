<p>When Mathcad cannot properly evaluate an expression, it returns an error. Errors 
  in a worksheet are highlighted in a different color (usually red), and clicking 
  on the expression displays an error message.</p>
  
  <p>Error messages can sometimes cover 
  the part of the calculation in error. You can press <b>[Esc]</b> to close an error message or use the mouse to drag the message out of the way.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="CantPlotAnyPoints">All evaluations resulted in either an error or 
  a complex result.</a></h3>
<p>When displaying a 2D graph, Mathcad only plots the real value of each data 
  point. If the expression you are plotting has no real result, the graph 
  returns an error.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="VectorElementsCannotAllBeTheSame">All the elements in the vector 
  cannot be the same.</a></h3>
<p>When using a <a href="Curve_fitting.html">fitting function</a>, the vector 
  of <b class="math">x</b> values must contain at least two distinct values.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="MustBeEitherScalarsOrStrings">All values must be either scalars or 
  strings.</a></h3>
<p>The array operation you're performing requires that some or all of the elements 
  be of the same type, either scalars or strings:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>When sorting an array, the column or row you are sorting on must contain 
      either scalar or string values. You cannot sort on a row or column containing 
      both.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When finding the <a href="Maxima_and_minima.html"><b class="math">maximum</b> 
      or <b class="math">minimum</b> of an array</a>, all of the array elements 
      must be of the same type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="ErrorInList">Arguments in function definitions must be names.</a></h3>
<p>The indicated function definition contains an invalid <a href="Defining_a_Function.html">list 
  of arguments</a>. A valid function definition begins like this:</p>
<p class="blockindent">function name (<a href="Defining_a_Function.html">argument 
  list</a>) := ...</p>
<p>The argument list must be a name or a list of names separated by commas. Any 
  other expression is illegal.</p>
<p>You see this error message if you create an invalid list in another context, 
  for example, in the list of y-axis expressions for a plot.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="InvalidDimension">Array has an incorrect number of rows and columns.</a></h3>
<p>You have attempted to perform an operation on a non-existent row or column.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="MustHaveAtLeast2Colors">Array must have at least two rows to represent 
  at least two colors.</a></h3>
<p>When saving an array as a colormap, each row in the array corresponds to a 
  different color. In order to vary a surface between two colors, the colormap 
  must contain two rows of color data.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="OneLimitMustBeInfinity">At least one limit must be infinity.</a></h3>
<p>When using the 'Infinite Limit' <a href="Numerical_integration_method.html">integration 
  method</a>, at least one of the limits on the integral must be positive or negative 
  <a href="Built_in_constants.html">infinity</a>.</p>
<p>To change the integration routine to something other than 'Infinite Limit,' 
  right-click on the integral and choose another routine from 
  the menu.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="NotConverging">This calculation does not converge to a solution.</a></h3>
<p>The expression you have entered does not converge to a solution using the iterative 
  solver you are applying. This message can be thrown by any operator or function 
  which uses successive approximation, such as integration, regression functions, 
  or other iterative methods, such as root finding. You can try better guess 
  values, breaking the expression into different regions to avoid discontinuities, 
  or reducing the value of TOL.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="TooManyIntegratorSteps">Can't converge to a solution. Encountered 
  too many integrator steps.</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="Solving_algorithms.html">algorithm</a> for this differential equation 
  solver did not find a solution. You can try changing your guess values for the 
  unknown initial conditions, although there may be no solution for the boundary 
  values you provided. You can also select another algorithm, which may converge 
  to a solution.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="Underflow">Can't evaluate this expression. A final or intermediate 
  result is too small to represent.</a></h3>
<p>Because of limitations in representing numbers in a computer, numbers 
  that are too small cannot be represented. Sometimes, especially in a complicated 
  calculation, the problem may lie with an intermediate result. When Mathcad encounters 
  such a number, it returns an underflow error.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="DefinitionStackOverflow">This expression cannot be evaluated. It 
  may have resulted in an overflow or infinite recursion.</a></h3>
<p>This function definition may contain too many nested functions. Or, if the 
  function is defined in terms of itself, it may result in an infinite recursion. 
  For example, if you define a function such as:</p>
<p class="vmath">f(x):=f(x)+5</p>
<p>and evaluate it by typing:</p>
<p class="vmath">f(10)=</p>
<p>this message appears.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, be careful when redefining a function in terms of itself.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="MustBeNonzero">Can't evaluate this function when its argument is 
  0.</a></h3>
<p>This function is undefined at zero.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="ODEerrors"></a>Cannot find expression for highest order derivative, 
  and other ODE/PDE errors.</h3>
<p>ODE and <a href="PDE_solve.html">PDE</a> solvers try to return specific information 
  about why they were unable to numerically solve your problem. These errors are 
  caused by problems that are not formatted the way Mathcad expects or which 
  are missing required information. See <a href="ode_solve.html">ODEsolve</a> 
  and <a href="ODE_solvers.html">command-line ODE solver</a> Help for more information.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="slvNoSoln">Can't find a solution to this system of equations.</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the solver fails to converge on a solution. This happens when the 
  difference between successive approximations to the solution is greater than 
  <a href="Accuracy.html">TOL</a> <i>and</i>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>The solver reaches a point where it cannot reduce the error any further.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solver reaches a point from which there is no preferred direction, 
      so the solver has no basis on which to make further iterations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solver reaches the limit of its accuracy. This may happen if you 
      set <a href="Accuracy.html">TOL</a> to a value below 10<sup style="font-size: x-small;">-15</sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure there really is a solution. Then try:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Raising the value of <a href="Built_in_constants.html">TOL</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the <b><a href="Approximate_solutions.html">minerr</a></b> function 
      instead of the <a href="find.html"><b>find</b></a> function.</p>

<h3><a name="FileNotFound">Can't find the data file you're trying to use.</a></h3>
<p>The worksheet cannot find the data file or other type of file you are referencing. 
  Make sure the file exists in the location you've specified.</p>
<p>If you are using a function such as <b>READPRN</b> or <b>WRITEPRN</b>, make 
  sure you typed the argument as a <a href="Pathname.html">pathname</a> to the 
  data file.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="OnlyOneArrayAllowed">Can't have more than one array in a contour 
  plot.</a></h3>
<p>You entered more than one array in the <a href="Placeholder_defined.html">placeholder</a> 
  of a contour or surface plot. You can only have one array at a time in that 
  placeholder because contour and surface plots can only represent a single surface 
  at a time.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="IllegalArrayOperation">Can't perform this operation on the entire 
  array at once. Try using 'vectorize' to perform it element by element.</a></h3>
<p>One of the arguments to a function or operator in the expression is a vector 
  or matrix, instead of a scalar. You see this message if you try 
  to divide one vector by another, since the division operator only works with 
  scalars.</p>
<p>If you want to apply a function or operator to every element in a vector or 
  matrix, use the <a href="Vectorize_operator.html">vectorize operator</a>.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="DimensionToNonrealPower">Can't raise an expression having units to 
  a complex power.</a></h3>
<p>You can only raise an expression with 
  units to a real power. If you want to raise an expression with 
  <a href="Units_and_Dimensions.html">units</a> to a complex power, you must 
  use the <a href="Expression_type_functions.html">SIUnitsOf</a> function to cancel 
  out the units.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="TooManyConstraints">Can't solve a system with this many equations.</a></h3>
<p>You cannot have this many equations in a solve block. You can solve nonlinear 
  systems of up to 200 variables and linear systems of up to 500 variables.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="FileError">Can't understand something in this data file. If this 
  file came from a spreadsheet, make sure you saved it as ASCII text only.</a></h3>
<p>The file you are trying to access with <a href="Read_ASCII.html">READPRN</a> 
  does not have the required format:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>The file must be ASCII with spaces or tabs separating the numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All lines in the data file must have the same number of values if you are 
      using <b>READPRN</b>. (Lines containing no values are ignored.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the file has the required format and you continue to see this error, try 
  removing any text from the file.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="IllegalRange">This range variable must be defined with sequential 
  values.</a></h3>
<p>You defined a range variable with a range that could not be understood. When 
  you <a href="Defining_a_range_variable.html">define a range</a>, you must use 
  one of the following forms:</p>
<p class="vmath"><span class="math">Rvar := n1 ..n2</span></p>
<p class="vmath"><span class="math">Rvar := n1,n2 ..n3</span></p>
<p>You can use at most one comma and one semicolon in the definition of a range 
  for a range variable. If you use the second form, the value of <span class="math">n2</span> 
  must lie between the values of <span class="math">n1</span> and <span class="math">n3</span>, 
  but cannot equal <span class="math">n1</span>.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="RangeNotAllowed">Can't use a range variable in a solve block.</a></h3>
<p><a href="Defining_a_range_variable.html">Range variables</a> cannot be used 
  within a <a href="Solve_Block.html">solve block</a>. If you want to iterate 
  the solution to a solve block, define the output of the block as a function 
  of one of the solve block parameters, such as a guess value, and use a range 
  variable or program loop to iterate that function.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="BadConstant">The exponentiation operator requires a constant exponent 
  when applied to a value with units.</a></h3>
<h3>The nth root operator requires a constant radical when applied to a value 
  with units.</h3>
<h3>The order of the derivative must be a constant when this operator is applied 
  to an expression with units.</h3>
<h3>The determinant operator requires a square matrix of unitless values. This 
  matrix has elements of the form: <i>&lt;unit&gt;</i>.</h3>
<p>To <a href="Units_and_Dimensions.html">unit</a> balance an exponent, nth-root, 
  or derivative equation, the units of the result must depend only on the units 
  of the arguments, not on the numeric value of the arguments. Explicit (constant) 
  values must be used to calculate the powers of a quantity with units. This means 
  you cannot assign the exponent, radical, or order of the derivative with a function 
  argument, or a variable name defined in the worksheet.</p>
<p>Since the units of the determinant of a matrix depend upon the size of the 
  matrix, only unitless values are accepted here.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="BadRational">This exponent must have a larger fractional part 
  to be applied to a value with units.</a></h3>
<h3> This radical is too large to be extracted from a value with units.<br>
</h3>
<p>To preserve floating point accuracy in calculations with units, Mathcad restricts 
  exponents of united values to rational fraction with denominators no larger 
  than 60,000. The same rules applies in inverse to the radicals of nth roots.<br>
</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="NoDuplicates">No value occurs more than any others.</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad cannot determine the mode of this data. No single value occurs more 
  frequently than any others.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="Multimodal">Multimodal - more than one value occurs at the highest 
  frequency.</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad is unable to return the mode of the data because the data is multimodal. 
  More than one value occurs at the highest frequency.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="SignificanceReduced">Cannot evaluate this accurately at one or more 
  of the specified values.</a></h3>
<p>You tried to evaluate a function at a value outside its range of accuracy.</p>
<p>This error occurs in cases such as evaluating sin(10<sup style="font-size: x-small;">100</sup>). 
  Since the value of sin(10<sup style="font-size: x-small;">100</sup>) depends 
  on the ones digit of 10<sup style="font-size: x-small;">100</sup>, any value 
  that comes back would have no significant digits. Instead of seeing a value 
  of dubious accuracy, Mathcad returns an error.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="CantInterpolate">Cannot interpolate 3-D scatter data. All points 
  lie in a line.</a></h3>
<p>The data you are attempting to graph represents a line, rather than a plane. 
  Pass your data as an array, rather than a series of vectors.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="InvalidOrder">The order of the derivative must be between 0 and 5.</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad can only numerically evaluate <a href="Differentiation_operator.html">derivatives</a> 
  up to 5<sup style="font-size: x-small;">th</sup> order. In order to evaluate 
  a derivative of order greater than 5, you must do so <a href="Symbolic_integration.html">symbolically.</a></p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="NoSolutionFound">Could not find a solution.</a></h3>
<p>A solution could not be found. If you're using a built-in function, check its 
  documentation to make sure you are using the function correctly. It is possible, 
  however, that no solution exists.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="RootFinderFailed">Could not find a solution because the root finder 
  failed.</a></h3>
<p>Results from some differential equation solvers require iteration. If, after 
  many successive iterations, estimates still differ substantially, 
  you'll see this error message. Try using different guess values.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="TooManyIterations">Could not find a solution. Encountered too many 
  iterations.</a></h3>
<p align=left>The function has passed through as many iterations as possible trying 
  to find a solution. If you see this message when using the <a href="Finding_roots.html">polyroots</a> 
  function, the degree of the polynomial may be too high. Try solving for the 
  roots <a href="Symbolic_solving.html">symbolically</a>.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="MustBe3Vector">Cross product is defined only for vectors having exactly 
  three elements.</a></h3>
<p align="left">The vector <a href="Cross_product_operator.html">cross product</a> 
  is defined only for vectors having three elements.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="DegreeOfThePolynomialMustBeBetween1And99">Degree of the polynomial 
  must be between 1 and 99.</a></h3>
<p>The vector passed to the <a href="Finding_roots.html">polyroots</a> function 
  must have at least two elements and no more than ninety-nine.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="OrderNotAllowed">Derivatives of this order are not allowed.</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad does not allow time derivatives of second order or higher, or spatial 
  derivatives of third order or higher, when solving a <acronym lang="en" title="Partial Differential Equation"><a href="PDE_solve.html">PDE</a></acronym>.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="BadRangeDimArg">Dimensioned ranges must specify the second value 
  in the range.</a></h3>
<p>Range variables that have units associated with the values in the range must 
  have an explicit step size, specified by putting the second value in the range 
  definition. This prevents ambiguity when using units that are different from 
  the <a href="Dialog_Worksheet_Options.html#UnitSystem">base unit</a> in the 
  current worksheet system.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="FileIOError">Encountered a file I/O error.</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad was not able to properly read in data from a data file. Check that 
  you are not trying to read data points that do not exist in the file.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="FloatingPointError">Encountered a floating point error.</a></h3>
<p>You are evaluating a function at a point that is not allowed. For example, 
  the fifth argument to the <b>relax</b> function in Mathcad cannot have zeros 
  in the non-boundary positions of the coefficient matrix.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="BadInit">Error in initial conditions.</a></h3>
<p>This error occurs when your initial conditions do not match the expressions 
  for functions in an <a href="ode_solve.html">ODE</a> or <a href="PDE_solve.html">PDE</a> 
  solve block. There may be too few or too many initial conditions, or the values 
  specified may not match the functions.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="ODEBadBlock">Error in ODE Block</a></h3>
<p>Mathcad has encountered an error in your ODE solve block. This error may be 
  due to one of several factors:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Your solve block specifies derivatives of more functions than there are 
      equations: (<span class="math">n</span> equations in fewer than <span
	 class="math">n</span> unknown functions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <a href="ode_solve.html">constraints and initial conditions</a> are 
      insufficient or over-restrictive for the number of unknown functions. The 
      number of conditions must be equal to the sum of the orders of the ODEs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The solver was unable to interpret the system of ODEs. Check 
      your function names, check that all functions are specified with the variable 
      <span class="math">(x(t)</span>, not just <span class="math">x)</span>, 
      check that all derivative initial conditions are given using prime notation 
      <b>[Ctrl]&nbsp;[F7]</b>, and that ODEs are linear in their highest-order derivatives. 
      See the description of <a href="ode_solve.html">Odesolve</a> for more details.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="Overflow">Found a number with a magnitude greater than 10^307 while 
  trying to evaluate this expression.</a></h3>
<p>Because of limitations inherent in representing floating-point numbers with 
  a computer, Mathcad cannot accurately sign floating-point numbers of magnitude 
  greater than 10<sup style="font-size: x-small;">307</sup>. When an evaluation 
  involves such a large number, even as an intermediate result, Mathcad returns 
  this error message.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="Singularity">Found a singularity while evaluating this expression.</a></h3>
<p>You evaluated a function or performed an operation at an illegal value. This 
  error generally occurs when you either divide by zero or try to invert a singular 
  matrix.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="IllegalContext">This range variable is not referenced in the left 
  hand side of the definition</a> - or - Illegal context.</h3>
<p>The most common causes of this error message are:</p>

  of the same type.</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="InvalidNumberOfKnots">Incorrect number of knots.</a></h3>
<p>The number of knots in this function are incorrect.</p>
<p>Unlike other <a href="Cubic_spline_interpolation.html">spline interpolation 
  functions</a>, the <a href="Bspline_interpolation.html">Bspline function</a>

<p>You have attempted to use an <a href="Program_Conditional.html">otherwise</a> 
  statement without preceding <a href="Program_Control.html">if</a> statement.</p>
<p>The otherwise operator, analagous to the <i>else</i> keyword in C++, is used 
  to identify cases which fail a <a href="Program_Conditional.html">conditional</a> 
  test during execution, usually to set an alternate value for a variable. In 
  any case, the otherwise statement only executes in conjunction with an if statement, 
  such as:</p>
<p class="blockindent"><img src="Graphics/prog_if6.gif" alt="otherwise operator" width="222" height="59" border="0"></p>

<p>In this case the program returns 0 for any value of <span class="math">x &gt; 
  2</span> or <span class="math">x &lt; &minus;2</span>. For values of <span class="hmath">x</span> 
  between &minus;2 and 2, inclusive, the program instead returns the value of

<hr width="50%">
<h3><a name="BadBreak">This 'break' must occur within a loop.</a></h3>
<p>You have used a <a href="Program_Control.html">break</a> outside of a 
  <a href="Program_Loops.html#ForLoops">for</a> or <a href="Program_Loops.html#WhileLoops">while</a> 
  loop.</p>
<p><b>break</b> is designed to halt execution of a loop. Generally, break is used 
  on the left side of an <a href="Program_Control.html">if</a> statement, exiting 
  the loop and resuming execution of the program with the statement immediately 
  after the loop.</p>
<p>In the following example, break terminates the loop for values of <span class="math">x 
  &gt; 4</span> and moves to the next statement, which returns the current value 
  of <span
 class="math">z</span>.</p>

<h3><a name="BadContinue">This 'continue' must occur within a loop.</a></h3>

  of a <a href="Program_Loops.html#ForLoops">for</a> or <a href="Program_Loops.html#WhileLoops">while</a> 
  loop.</p>
<p><b>continue</b> is designed to skip a particular iteration of a loop, resuming 
  execution with the next iteration. Generally, continue is used on the left side 
  of an <a href="Program_Control.html">if</a> statement, skipping any remaining 
  statements in the current iteration of the loop and resuming execution with 
  the next iteration.</p>
<p>For example, here continue is used to create an array with data only in the 
  even-numbered columns:</p>
<p class="blockindent"><img src="Graphics/PRGCONT3.GIF" alt="continue causes the program to skip writing data in certain columns" width="351" height="172" align="bottom" border="0"></p>
<p>When <b class="math">j</b> is even, continue causes calculation to immediately
